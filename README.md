# Project_01-Certified-Preowned-Processor
This project adds to the ALU project in both functionality and complexity, and puts your understanding of Chapter 4.4 to the test. Gain more experience and understanding in Verilog.

Tasks

  1. (100 pts) At a minimum, implement the single-cycle implementation as described in 4.4, handling the subset of instructions (ALU funcs, lw/sw, beq, jump) mentioned.
  2. (20 pts) Implement 5-stage pipelining as shown in 4.7.
